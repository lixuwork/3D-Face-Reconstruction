## Introduction

 In computer vision and computer graphics, 3D face reconstruction is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of human faces. This process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods. If the model is allowed to change its shape in time, this is referred to as non-rigid or spatiotemporal reconstruction.
