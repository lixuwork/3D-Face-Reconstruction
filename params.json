This process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods. If the model is allowed to change its shape in time, this is referred to as non-rigid or spatiotemporal reconstruction.  \r\n Please refer to the following videos to better under what is 3D face reconstruction:   \r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu7bTemvEKk (YouTube video)  \r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhdT8MzIg_0 (YouTube video)\r\n \r\n## Reference\r\n1.
